# StockPricesDashboard
A dynamic dashboard built with shiny.

In this project I built a dynamic dashboard in collaboration with Guido Giacomo Mussini. The aim is to display in an intuitive way the trends of the desired companies.

There are three pages:
1 - Adjusted Close 
2 - Sales 
3 - Candlestick 

In the first two pages a forecast mode is available. This will forecast the adjusted close or the sales on the desired horizon, thanks to xgboost
